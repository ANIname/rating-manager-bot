# Main Discord Bot

## About

This is the main Discord bot for the server. It handles events that happen in the server. It also handles the slash commands.

We use [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) to handle Discord events. (message, guildMemberAdd, etc.) See the [Events documentation](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/main/Client:Class#applicationCommandPermissionsUpdate) for more information.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Start the application with `make` command.
  * `NPM Dependencies` will be installed automatically if they are not already installed.
